Ask the Manual is an intelligent and interactive platform designed to simplify how users access, understand, and interact with technical or product-related information. The platform acts as a smart assistant that allows users to query any manual, guide, or documentation and instantly receive clear, contextual, and easy-to-understand responses.

Instead of scrolling through lengthy manuals or complex PDFs, users can simply “ask” their question in natural language — and the system retrieves the relevant section, summarizes it, and delivers a precise answer.

The project combines a clean, minimal, and responsive user interface with a powerful backend that manages user authentication, history tracking, and personalized experiences. Users can log in or sign up to save their query history, revisit previous searches, and receive email updates or confirmations powered by Resend API.

Additionally, Ask the Manual includes both light and dark mode for a visually adaptive experience, ensuring usability across all devices. The system’s integration with MongoDB ensures secure and efficient storage of user data and interaction logs, while JWT-based authentication maintains robust user privacy and session control.

Overall, Ask the Manual revolutionizes how people interact with instruction manuals by merging simplicity, accessibility, and intelligence into one seamless platform — turning static documentation into a dynamic, user-friendly conversational experience.
